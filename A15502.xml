         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20871:3"/>common vſe, their ſayd labours: It being then ſo with me, that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to make publike this ſmal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, diſcourſing of one of the maine Duties of Chriſtianity: I thought it was meete to go the Common Roade, that none through praejudice might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reject the Worke, as altogether worthleſſe, or deſpiſe the Author, as altogether friendleſſe; but that, that authority, which the Word of God hath and ought to haue among Chriſtians, might by an externall, and ſecondary teſtimony of men of worth, be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and countenanced.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore preſumed (though without your privity) to take vp your Worſhips Name to be as an ornament to the work; that thoſe who know not the Author (as being an obſcure man) might not yet deſpiſe it, while it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of ſuch a one, of whom the Church of God hath long agon taken notice of as Foſter-Father; and the Common-wealth reioyced in as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
<pb facs="tcp:20871:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>and graue Officer and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Yet in this buſineſſe I had ſome ſtrife in my ſelfe, while on the one ſide I conſidered your naturall Diſpoſition which deſires not, as indeede you need not, the applauſe of pen and paper; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many reall and ſolid praeconies &amp; teſtimonies of your laudable, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, I was deterred: But when on the other ſide I conſidered my duty and that ſpeciall obligation I ſtand bound in, to your Worſhips, for your many fauours, I could not but expreſſe ſome euidence &amp; teſtimony of a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde; and knowing that none of the common kinde wherewith the world doth gratifie her benefactors, would not be acceptable to you, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from a Scholler and Miniſter: I am bold to preſent ſuch as beſt befits me, and pleaſes your ſelfe; accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a teſtimony of a thankfull minde, and ſuch as if in no other regard might be acceptable; yet as it reioyces the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or Gardiner to taſte of his
<pb facs="tcp:20871:4"/>planted and grafted fruites: ſo ſeeing this is a handfull of that fruite which hath ſprung from that Tree, which was firſt planted in the Garden of God, by your hand, and is ſtill watered and warmed by the dew and beames of your beneficence: I hope it will not be vnpleaſing to you, and the Church of God will thankfully acknowledge, that what euerfruite hath, or may growe hence, that, vnder God, it is to bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to your moſt Chriſtian piety and care of the ſame: Who finding one of the Daughters of <hi>Syon</hi> harbourleſſe and ragged, hath honeſtly houſed her, and cloathed her. I had not thought (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Worſhipfull Sir) to haue gone thus farre, when I put Pen to paper, to ſpeake of your prayſe to your ſelfe or other, for I know it pleaſes you not; yet let God be glorified, and his ſeruants honoured.</p>
            <p>To returne then, ſeeking a Patron for my Worke; who may be thought fitter then the Patron of the worker?
<pb facs="tcp:20871:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lords in old time did challenge, and the Law of God allowed it, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of ſervants was their Maiſters wholly and ſure; how euer the worke for the outward lincaments may not ſeeme worthy your iudicious eye, and great learning, yet for the matter being taken out of Gods Booke, which by your dayly practiſe I can witneſſe, is moſt precious vnto you; I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing borrowed thence, can ſeeme contemptible.</p>
            <p>I pray you therefore accept in good worth this my tendred ſeruice; and as the Lord accepts of his ſeruants works not by the worke it ſelfe, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the heart and minde of the worker; ſo iudge not of it, I pray you, by the out ſide, but by the affection of the giver.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, in this little Treatiſe I offer to thy view one point of thy profeſſion, ſuch as is thy Alpha and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega, the beginning and perfiting of a Chriſtian: the first to bee learned ere thou canſt ſet thy foote ouer the Threſhold of Chriſts Schoole, and yet not perfectly learned till thou beeſt in Chriſts glorious Kingdome. The conſideration of this one point will helpe, direct, and ſettle thy muſing thoughts about many things that befall the courſe and condition of Religion in the World; for heere is diſcouered the ſtepmother of all true Religion, whither we conſider the rule and doctrine of it, or the practiſe of it: Here alſo thou mayſt ſee the ariſing and encreaſing of all falſe Religion comming out of the earth and ſea of mans
<pb facs="tcp:20871:6"/>carnall earthly heart, and troubleſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Heere thou ſhalt ſee as it were vnder one Roofe, a Priſon and a ſhoppe or forge; a Priſon wherein thou mayst behold Diuine truth, and ſacred Religion chayned and bound with many Fetters in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Iayle of Selfe-conceite, and Selfe-loue. Heere againe thou mayſt behold the Shop and Forge wherein are wrought, and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered out the frame and fabricke of all falſe religions and opinions, both within and without the Church. Here thou mayſt behold the Seminary of all Hereſies, and factions that trouble the Church, the ground of the grand falſe and deceitfull religions that raigne in the World, as Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Prophane Mahumetiſme, Popiſh Hereſie and Superstition, all turbulent Schiſmes, as the late Arminianiſme, they ariſe all out of one bitter roote or fountaine before named; and to giue thee a little taſte and touch of them both.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, here thou mayſt ſee truths Priſon, wherein it is detayned in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and that with three chiefe bonds:
<pb facs="tcp:20871:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>The firſt is Selfe-conceit, ariſing from the want of Deniall of our owne mindes, wit, opinion, reaſon, fancies, and wiſdomes: for ſuch beeing the naturall blindneſſe of the minde that it cannot conceaue many truths, ſuch is alſo the Naturall dotage to conceite and invent of it ſelf, or to receiue from other any strange fictions, vanities, curioſities, or what pleaſes the carnall fancies of men, that truth is neglected either as not knowne, or rejected as not pleaſing: ſo that, with this one chayne Selfe-conceite, doth bind vp many precious truths, or ſeale them vp vnder the priuie ſeale of Ignorances. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> notes in the <hi>Romane Gentiles,</hi> and others, that while they profeſſed themſelues wiſe, they became fooles, ſo that when in ſome ſort they knew God, they did not glorifie him as God, but became vaine in their imaginations, or diſcourſes rayſed thence; and their fooliſh hearts were full of darkneſſe, ſo that in the end they turned the Truth of God into a lye.</p>
            <p>Adde vnto this as a part of it a defect or viciouſneſſe that is in the practuall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:20871:7"/>called conſcience; which when it ſhould giue a perfect direction before, and a right verdict after our actions or conceits, it is erronious, dull, idle: not willing to examine things, apt to be deceiued, and ſo to excuſe or witneſſe with, as good, when it ſhould accuſe and witneſſe against, as bad. So that as many a man of a naughty conſcience as wee ſpeake, who knowes ſome particular truth or fact, yet ſmoothers them, not caring to reueale them: ſo is it naturally with man through this defiled conſcience, which is as a graue to burie many holy truths in. Alas lamentable experience ſufficiently witneſſes this ſame, both in the generall, and in many particulars; as is ſeene in many Papiſts eyther ignorant, and miſ-in-formed, or dreaming and ill minded ones, who ſee and know the truth, but they loue it not, and therefore will not giue witneſſe of it: but as they haue laboured to get in, and burne many Bookes of Holy Truth, ſo do they ſuppreſſe the ſame in their mindes. But if the beames of Diuine truth break &amp; pierce into the darkneſſe of the minde, it would
<pb facs="tcp:20871:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>giue forth ſome luſter thence to the whole man; then a ſecond bond is at hand to bind this Truth, and that is, Selfe-will, the will taking vpon her as a Iudge to examine all evidence, all places, tenents, propoſitions; and if they pleaſe not the will, they are then rejected and paſſe no further, eyther ſecretly checking the vnderſtanding, as too buſie in her informations, or onely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reaſons projected, or cunningly turning them another way, reſolued they ſhall not haue her aſſent and confirmation, and ſo be dead and nipped in the head: ſo that the will <hi>Procruſtes</hi>-like ſtretches out each opinion to the length of her meaſure, or cutting off what is longer, ſo that partly mans inability in his electiue faculty, and partly its wilfulnes refuſing truths ſhewed by the vnderſtanding, reſtraynes many parts of Diuine truth; as was alſo ſeene in many Phariſies in the dayes of Chriſt, who ſaw and were oft convinced, but wilfully went from and againſt the ſame: ſuch alſo is the condition of many wilfull Papiſts in theſe our dayes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20871:8"/>
            <p>But if truth paſſe the vpper part of the ſoule, as reaſon, conſcience, and will, and that now there might be hope, there would bee no ſtoppage; to a third, and that a ſtrong and violent band to offer violence, and to make a new faction and Head; and this is Selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue: who leades a multitude of violent and clamorous paſſions, drowning and crying downe the voyce and iudgement of reaſon, as we ſee oft in many elections, the greater and baſer part to bee carried against the ſmaller and wiſer. For when holy truth fals into the hands of theſe, ſhee is carried from her owne Barre where ſhe ſhould be tried, the Lawes by which ſhe ſhould bee iudged are refuſed, the lawfull Iudge depoſed, and ſometime enuy, malice, ſelfe-loue, pride, vaine-glory, ſometime other vnruly affections and paſſions are made the lawfull Iurie to be empenelled againſt truth, and if in any thing ſhe may be found an enemy to thy popular, ſenſuall and carnall ſtate, it is ſufficient to commit her to Priſon: Here things are examined how they ſtand with Honor, Pleaſure, profit, eaſe, or any worldly
<pb facs="tcp:20871:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>reſpects, and as they make with or againſt theſe, ſo haue they approbation or diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance: this of old was alledged againſt the truth, we will offer Cakes to the Queene of Heauen, for then we had plenty of all things.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Fellowes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hard againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and his religion: this carried the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies</hi> wholly againſt Chriſt, as Chriſt told them, How can yee beleeue, ſeeing yee ſeeke honour one of another, and not the Honor that comes of God? and in another place, if wee let him alone, all will follow him, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> will come and take our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and then as <hi>Michaiah</hi> muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned becauſe hee ſpeakes not good for <hi>Ahab;</hi> and as the <hi>Philiſtimes</hi> though convinced of the truth and Maieſty of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet they encouraged one another, ſaying, Let vs quit our ſelues as men, that we be not ſlaues to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</hi> Thus doth Naturall men, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with carnall paſſions. This is clearly ſeene by that anſwer, that learned <hi>Eraſmus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20871:9"/>made to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his iudgement touching <hi>Luthers</hi> cauſe, anſwered it was true and iuſt: The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying why then doe they rage againſt him, he anſwered becauſe he ſtracke at the Popes Triple Crowne, and ſought to pull the <hi>Luncions</hi> or full Dyet from the Monkes belly; ſo that by this, that hath beene ſayd, the firſt point is ſufficiently cleared, ſo that wee neede not go farre to enquire after diſcountenancing of Truth: ill thriving and many ſtoppages it findes, for ſometimes it meetes with one of theſe, ſometimes with another; ſo that, till the Lord breake theſe hands, Truth fayles, and Religion cannot enter, as the Prophet complaines in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>For the latter, I muſt be briefe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needes it any further proofe: for that which is prooued an enemy to Truth, is alwayes a friend to the contrary, ſo that theſe three, Selfe-conceite, Selfe-will, Selfe-loue, they are the inventors, the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, maintayners, and euery way mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiers of all falſe Religions, as beeing the

            <p>Hence it was that at the firſt ſetting vp of

            <p>
               <hi>Let a man deny himſelfe:<note place="margin">The Text.</note> Matthew</hi> ſayes, <hi>Let a man forſake himſelfe:</hi> The Word here ſignifies, not a ſimple or weake <hi>deniall,</hi> but a ſtout and conſtant <hi>deniall,</hi> a <hi>deniall</hi> againe and againe: It is a kinde of phraſe much vſed in Scripture, borrowed from great men, or Maiſters of Requeſts, who if they be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned in any thing vnlawfull or vnfitting, they doe conſtantly deny the petitions.

<pb facs="tcp:20871:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>doth require of his followers that they ſhould <hi>deny</hi> their reaſon, and nature, to put off all humane affections, and naturall deſires, ſo as to be brute Beaſts, to become a ſtocke without life or ſence: For reaſon and affection haue their place, and vſe in man; but in one word heereby is commanded the renouncing of all that is in vs, which wee haue brought on our ſelues as our handy-workes, beſides and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that wee were created at the firſt: So that to <hi>deny</hi> our ſelues is, that in matters of Religion, in iudging of Gods truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in affecting or diſliking any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee ſhould not aduiſe with our owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon, humane wiſedome, worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or receiue, or reject any thing in it as it was pleaſing and plauſible to our owne priuate iudgements: Yea, that what euer thing was good in vs of it ſelfe, yet if it became any bindrance to the ready and entire embracing of Chriſt, that wee ſhould renounce the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motions and placites of our owne mindes, to neglect our owne affections, to repreſſe all the counſells and perſwaſions of the fleſh, to liue not to our ſelues but to God, and all for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This <hi>deniall</hi> is to be practiſed according to all the parts and powers of the ſoule; as <hi>minde, will, deſire, affection, appetite, &amp;c.</hi> Briefly that wee offering our ſelues to bee worſhippers and ſeruants of God and Chriſt, wee doe no way
<pb facs="tcp:20871:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeeke our owne eaſe, pleaſure, profit, glory; but ſet our ſelues wholly to glorifie God, and do good to our Chriſtian brother: So then the meaning being cleared; the Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing hence is this.</p>

            <p>Firſt, for the Actiue obedience in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God this Denyall is neceſſary,<note place="margin">1. Actiue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> for ſeeing the Lord forbids therein many things that are moſt pleaſing to our carnall reaſon; and one the contrary commands many things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame, who ſees not that without the Denyall of our owne wiſedome and reaſon, we ſhall neither ſhunne the one, nor entertaine the other. And indeed from hence hath ſprung ſo many deuiſed and falſe religions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhipping of God, and from hence it is, that men are ready either to fall off from the true worſhip, or to mingle therewith many of their inuentions, it hath come from no other thing, then the not Denyall of our reaſon, while we ſeeke to obtrude on God what we like, and
<pb facs="tcp:20871:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>thinke that the things we like not, that he doeth ſo likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is neceſſary in all the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and the meanes of our ſaluation, as the preaching of the word, or the hearing of the ſame, the right manner of calling on the name of God, and the right eſteeme and vſage of the holy Sacraments: For whence comes the neglect of that plaine and ſimple manner of preaching, and the ſpeaking in the entiſing ſpeaches of Eloquence, but that in our carnall reaſon we thinke that more glorious, and ſuch as wherein we may ſhew our owne wit, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an opinion of humane learning and gaine a plauſe: and in the meane while we make voyde the power of the Croſſe, and the work of gods grace which moſt ſhewes it ſelfe in our weakenes: Whence is it alſo, that of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the ordinance of preaching is counted follie and is ſpurned againſt: but that men would bee ſaued by other meanes more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their carnall deſires, or proude conceit of their owne wiſedome. Whence is it likewiſe that though things be ſpoken neuer ſo plainely out of Gods word, both for the dehorting from ſundry vaine opinions and vices, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to receiue ſuch and ſuch doctrines of trueth and piety,<note place="margin">The cauſe why the doctrine of Piety is not berter practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is want of Selfe-Denyall.</note> yet there is no more fruite in a willing forſaking the one, and a ready embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the other; but that men are wedded to their owne wiſedomes, will, carnall affections,
<pb facs="tcp:20871:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Deſires, which are croſſed in many things in the Word of God. Briefly, whence is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that baſe eſteeme and vnreuerent vſage of the holy Sacraments, but that we ſubiect not our ſelues to a ſerious meditation and a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall view of Gods goodneſſe and wiſedome ſhining in the ſame: Whence alſo is that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Images, on Beades, the mediation of Saints, but that theſe are agreable to the courſes of men, and mans owne proper ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, comparing and likening our dealing and ſeeking to God, with our vſuall ſeeking to great ones: So that wee ſhall neuer eyther with reuerence, vſe, or profit by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, without the whole denyall of our ſelues.</p>

            <p>What made the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſo offended with Chriſts doctrine,<note place="margin">9. Iewes.

            <p>Briefly,<note place="margin">10. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes. Luke. 7.37.</note> what made the Phariſes ſo oft cauill at, and take offence at the doctrine and doings of our Sauiour, as <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37.38. with his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the ſinful woman.<note place="margin">Luke. 15.3.

For cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and dyning with <hi>Zacheus.</hi> All theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a high conceit and pride of their owne holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging carnally of Chriſt his doctrine and doing: Yea why did they renounce the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but becauſe they loued and admired their owne: and why did they not beleeue in him, but as Chriſt told them they ſought praiſe one of another, and ſought not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory that was of God. So that by all theſe examples it may appeare how dangerous a thing it is not to Deny our ſelues in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, ſo that nothing is well done, wherein carnall reaſon and wiſedome hath place, as might further bee ſhewed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Sarah</hi> giuing counſell to <hi>Abraham</hi> to goe in into his maide: And of <hi>Rebechas</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the birth-right for her ſonne <hi>Iacob:</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:20871:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>both theſe actions may ſeeme to haue bin one faith in the promiſes made vnto them: but let the fore-named examples ſuffice to ſhew vnto vs the Neceſſitie of this duety; and ſo wee paſſe on briefly to declare the laſt, to wit, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thereof.</p>
            <p>Now let vs conſider the Excellencie of this duety,<note place="margin">The third generall head containes the excellencie of this duety of Denying of our ſelues.</note> although it may alſo appeare by that which hath bene ſayd, for if it be ſuch, as that without it wee cannot imbrace chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with perſeuerance, neither performe any duety to God, or Man, or our ſelues, as wee ought, then ſure, the Worth of this muſt needs be great, whereon all religion in practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſteth: yet this will more plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare if we come to conſider examples,<note place="margin">Examples out of Scripture.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whatſoeuer ſinguler worke hath beene done, or any great vertues, or acceptable ſeruice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by any of Gods worthy ſeruants, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to God, ſhalbee evinced, to haue ſprung from this very ground, the Denyall of themſelues:<note place="margin">Note.</note> And on the contrary the want of it hath carried diuers into many ſinnes, and foule and enormious offences, and with-held them either from beleeuing, or iudging a right either of Chriſts doctrine and doing: ſo this takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all offence and ſo makes them bleſſed, as Chriſt pronounced them to bee that tooke no offence at him or his doctrine. The ſcope of all religion is, that due Obedience may bee giuen to god, and it is that which moſt pleaſeth him.
<pb facs="tcp:20871:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now this can proceede from no other roote then the Denyall of our ſelues: For wee cannot do the will of God, and in all things ſuffer our ſelues to be led by it, till wee are become fooles in our owne iudgement and wiſedome: And therefore dare not will, nor truſt to it, eſpecially where we ſee it contrary to Gods will: So that moſt of thoſe worthy workes which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo highly extolls <hi>Heb.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 11. haue proceeded from no other roote then this, which becauſe it is taught by faith, they are aſcribed to it. But let vs ſee ſome particulars to demonſtrate the ſame.</p>
            <p>The firſt,<note place="margin">1. Noah. Gen. 6.22.</note> ſhalbe of <hi>Noahs</hi> in preparing and building the Arke, whence came this obedience but from this:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> True it is that the Apoſtle doeth aſcribe it to <hi>Noahs</hi> faith, but why, that is to be conſidered, which is this, that faith doeth ſhut vp the eye of reaſon, and carnall imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and makes vs wholly follow the will of God. For if <hi>Noah</hi> had giuen way to a thouſand thoughts, and feares of impoſſibility of beeing ſo ſaued; and had not learned to deny his owne wiſedome, and reaſon, doe we thinke he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gone about it, eſpecially continued to the end, if he would haue beene led by reaſon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thence he would rather haue laughed at it as vnlikely matter and abſurd, that either God ſhould bee ſo eruell, as to deſtroy the whole world, or if Gods iuſtice did prouoke him to this, yet that hee and his, alone ſhould eſcape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
<pb facs="tcp:20871:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that the Ship ſhould not ſome way or other miſcarrie, requires more then nature and to goe out of our ſelues by faith in Gods promiſe.<note place="margin">2. Abraham.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But paſſe we from <hi>Noah</hi> to that memorable aboue all the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull and patterne of all obedience, whence aroſe that ready and willing obeying Gods voyce, in forſaking his countrie, kindred,<note place="margin">Iames. 2.21.</note> and friendes,<note place="margin">Gen 12.1.4.5. Heb. 11.8, 9, 10</note> to goe into a land he knew not what or where, but that hee had learned a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of them all, with carnall wiſedome that pleaded hard for the ſame. But yet more memorable and notable was that worke of his in beeing ready to offer vp and conſecrate his ſonne to God,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.2.9, 10 Heb. 11.17.</note> to whoſe peculiar perſon the maine promiſe of bleſſednes was annexed. Was not here an admirable Denyall of himſelfe? Oh what a conflict did he vndergoe in the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the affections of nature, and againſt all reaſon and humanitie in ſhew: Sure if in any thing he had aduiſed with the fleſh, he had bin ſtaied, but as in wiſedome he concealed it from his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> leaſt ſhee ſhould haue withſtood him, ſo did hee no leſſe fight againſt himſelfe and reaſon from which hee could not hide it: Neither may the praiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> bee obſeured,<note place="margin">Iſaac.</note> who as a true figure of Chriſt vnderſtanding by his Father the will of God, voluntarily offered vp his owne ſelfe.<note place="margin">3.

<pb facs="tcp:20871:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>then if he had ſwayed the Scepter, not onely of that, but of all the kingdomes of the world without this Denyall.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5. Naaman.</note> fit for this purpoſe is the example of <hi>Naaman,</hi> who though at firſt,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our corruption.</note> vnto prayer there muſt bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned a ſight and acknowledgment of our owne naturall corruption, and a diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of our daily ſinnes and a ſuppreſſing of them by a continuall preſſing and vrging of the authority of God vppon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for that muſt make the reſt to heare: for by reaſon of our naturall corruption, the minde, reaſon, and iudgment, the wil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are ſo corrupted, blinde, peruerted, and euery way diſtempered, that they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnfit to iudge of heauenly and ſpiritual things: and ſo not to bee conceited of them, nor to truſt them in that kind.</p>
            <p>Heereuppon wee muſt labour for Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whereby our minde, iudgment, will,<note place="margin">3 Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> affections, are renewed, ordered, and made conformable to the minde and will of God: ſo that the more wee are Regenerate, the more wilingly wee ſubiect our ſence and reaſon to God; and minde and affect the ſame things with him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20871:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 Faith.</note> Faith is an excellent meanes to make vs deny our ſelues, for when wee ſhall by it haue learned to liue not by ſence or light or reaſon, but to ſhut the eye of all theſe, and to open the eare to follow the voyce and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God, then it wil bee no hard taske as wee haue ſeene in all the former examples: who the more ſtrong in faith, the more ready in the practiſe of this.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5 The conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation whoſe we are by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> the conſideration whoſe we are, and how wee haue entered a couenant with God, wherein wee promiſed to renounce the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> and all the vanityes and pleaſures of this life, and to conſecrate our ſelues both ſoules and bodies wholy to God, and being his ſeruants to reſolue to doe his will: ſo that it is not free to vs, and in our power to diſpoſe of ourſelues as wee would: but remembering that both by couenant on our part wee owe whatſoeuer wee are, and are to bee nothing in our ſelues, of our ſelues, and for our ſelues: but all things in God, by God, and for God.</p>
            <p>Seeing this is ſo chiefe a duty of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">1 Vſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> it ſerues firſt to reprooue ſundry ſorts, who profeſſe Chriſtianity, yet are farre from this, ſuch as liue in open prophaneſſe, as ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, lying, drunkenneſſe, breach of Gods Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths, vncleanneſſe, wantonneſſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for if they haue not learned to Deny vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, how ſhal they
<pb facs="tcp:20871:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>deny themſelues? for a man may ſo farre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and yet come much ſhort of a Deniall of himſelfe: it ſerueth alſo to reprooue al thoſe the ground and rule of whoſe religion, is either their good meaning, or humane reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Vſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> this ſhewes how difficult the practiſe and workes of Chriſtians are: euen a fighting, and an offering of violence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, reiecting and denying of al the ſuits, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, placets, and requeſts, that ariſe of our ſelues, and are made plauſible as tending to our owne content; this whoſoeuer tryes ſhal finde it a moſt hard thing, as to bee thus and thus conceited of himſelfe, and yet to giue no regard vnto it, to be carried with a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>climation of <hi>Will,</hi> to ſuch a thing as is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs as good, and yet to refuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſame, to renounce that which the bent of affections, and the earneſt ſuite of deſire hath carried vs after: as was the worthy example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who when hee had earneſtly deſired the water of the well of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> powred it out vppon the ground and would not drinke thereof: as on the contrary, when our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons carry vs to the miſlike off, and flying from a thing as grieuous, yet to imbrace that with ioy and delight: oh how happy a thing it is? this is a worke farre paſſing the feuereſt Popiſh diſcipline, which in their blinde deuotions men inflict on themſelues: <hi>As to wallow in the ſnow, and to caſt themſelues into the cold of waters:
<pb facs="tcp:20871:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>or to lye in hayre cloath, or in ſhirts of male;</hi> yea <hi>or with Baals Preiſts, to lanch their owne fleſh:</hi> yea or this alſo, <hi>to ſacrifice our owne Children to an Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Vſe of triall.</note> this ſerueth to bee as a touch-ſtone to try our eſtates by, for if we haue not attained this denyall in ſome meaſure, wee are yet to learne and to lay the firſt foundation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if by Gods grace wee are inabled to this worke, wee haue cauſe of much comfort in our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">4 Vſe of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> ſeeing this is ſo neceſſary and exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a duty, let theſe bee as two ſpurres in our ſides to ſtirre vs vp, and put vs forward to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with our ſelues, the practiſing of the ſame, as being that, whereby we enter the ſchole of Chriſt, as alſo being that whereby we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame without offence: oh how ſingular and worthy fruits would enſue of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and obedience vnto God, and of Loue and Vnity amongſt our ſelues, when all and euery of our owne Wills, would meete in the one onely will of God, as in a center: what though it bee as greuious to vs to Deny our ſelues, as it was to old <hi>Iacob</hi> to part with his beloued <hi>Beniamine,</hi> yet when he heard there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but either dye or yeald: then hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly refignes himſelfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.36.38. Gen. 43.8.10. Simile.</note> and his ſonne to God; and as Iacobs ſonnes told their Father, that had it not bin for that, they had returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine freſh victualed; ſo certainly were it not
<pb facs="tcp:20871:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>that our beloued ſinnes and inamored affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did reſtrayne vs, wee had bin richly lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all ſpirituall grace: but if at laſt wee ſhall willingly yeald: as <hi>Iacob</hi> met with ioy he looked not, both in hearing of his ſonne <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and in ſeeing him in honor: ſo if we would reſigne our ſelues ouer to the Lord, the Lord would aboundantly bleffe vs, and fill our hearts with ioy, and at death ſend his chariot of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells to fetch vs to himſelfe, to inioy his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence, who is more deare and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and that not in an earthly and fickle glory, but in that eternall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable happines in Heauen: to which end pray wee the Lord that Lee would make the weapons of our Spirituall warfarre,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> ſoe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to caſt downe all ſtrong imaginations, and bring euery thought into the ſubiection of Ieſus Chriſt, that ſo in the end, God may bee All in All. <hi>Amen.</hi>
